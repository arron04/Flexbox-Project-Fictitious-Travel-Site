              <h3>Weather</h3>
              <p>
                The Arctic is known for its cold temperatures, with average
                winter temperatures ranging from -30 to -10 degrees Celsius.
                Visitors should be prepared for the weather by bringing warm
                clothing, including thermal layers, a waterproof jacket, and
                insulated boots.

              <h3>Wildlife</h3>
              <p>
                The Arctic is home to a variety of unique wildlife, including
                polar bears, walruses, reindeer, and arctic foxes. Visitors may
                have the opportunity to view these animals in their natural
                habitat on an arctic tour.

              <h3>Northern Lights</h3>
              <p>
                One of the highlights of an arctic tour is the chance to see the
                Northern Lights, a natural phenomenon caused by solar particles
                colliding with the Earth's atmosphere. The best time to see the
                Northern Lights is during the winter months, when the nights are
                longest.

                Accommodations on an arctic tour can vary depending on the
                specific trip, but may include hotels, lodges, or even igloos.

              <p>
                Many arctic tour companies are committed to sustainable tourism
                practices, which aim to minimize the environmental impact of
                tourism and support the local communities. Visitors can feel
                good about supporting these efforts while enjoying a
                once-in-a-lifetime adventure.
