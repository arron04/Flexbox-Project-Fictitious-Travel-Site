# Flexbox Project for Codecademy 

A simple one page fictitious travel site I built to flex my Flexbox skills as part of the Front-End Engineer pathway on Codecademy.  

The site is built using everything we've been taught up until this point in the career path. 
I've worked with CSS and HTML for years but this is a good opportunity to refresh my knowledge.
